## Executive Summary

**Discoveries Tested:** 4
**Fully Validated:** 3
**Partially Validated:** 0
**Invalidated:** 1

---

## Discovery #1: Phi Occurrence Rate

**Status:** VALIDATED

**Claim:** 84.2% of configurations show phi
**Measured:** 84.2%
**Discrepancy:** 0.0 percentage points

**Conclusion:** Claim validated within acceptable margin.

---

## Discovery #2: Peak Phi at 72° and 108°

**Status:** VALIDATED

**Claim:** Both angles produce 5 phi candidates (peaks)
**Measured:**
  - 72°: 5 candidates
  - 108°: 5 candidates

**Conclusion:** Both angles confirmed as peaks with exactly 5 candidates.

---

## Discovery #3: 32-Point Geometry Consistency

**Status:** VALIDATED

**Claim:** 32 points is the modal (most common) configuration
**Measured:** Mode is 32 points
**32-point frequency:** 95.2%

**Conclusion:** 32 is indeed the modal value with majority occurrence.

---

## Discovery #4: Fourier Periodicities

**Status:** INVALIDATED

**Claim:** Periodicities at 180°, 90°, and 60°
**Measured:** Detected 0/3 expected periods

**Conclusion:** Expected periodicities not found in data.

---

## Methodology

Each discovery was tested against actual measurements:
1. **Phi Occurrence:** Multiple sweep resolutions (10°, 5°, 1°)
2. **Peak Angles:** Direct measurement + neighbor comparison
3. **Point Consistency:** Random sampling + statistical analysis
4. **Fourier:** FFT analysis of phi occurrence spectrum

All tests used `orion_octave_test.main()` with default parameters.
Results are reproducible and verifiable.

**Validation Integrity:** 3/4 discoveries fully validated
